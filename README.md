# Classical Muisc Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network for note-level music generative models in Python using TensorFlow.

Inspired from sherjilozair [char-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow).

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow](http://www.tensorflow.org)

# Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the tinyshakespeare corpus, run `python train.py`.

To sample from a checkpointed model, `python sample.py`.
# Roadmap
- Add explanatory comments
- Expose more command-line arguments
- Compare accuracy and performance with char-rnn
